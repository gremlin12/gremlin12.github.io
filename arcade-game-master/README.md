REVENGE OF THE MUTANT LADYBUGS

Giant ladybugs, mutated and energized by radioactive crystals, 
have overrun the city. Only You Can Save Us!

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Download the zip file and extract its contents.
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
3. Click on the "How to Play" link for instructions.
4. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your avatar.
5. Cross the road as many times as you can without bumping into any bugs.
6. Collect as many tokens on the way as you can.
7. Hearts give you an extra life. Keys reduce the number of bugs.
8. The game ends when you run out of lives. 


This game was created as a project for Udacity's Frontend Web-Developer Nanodegree.
The game engine and basic framework are contained in engine.js and resources.js and 
were provided by Udacity instructors. The rest, including app.js, is mostly my own work,
with a lot of help from my friends.

The ladybug "bite" sound is by Mike Koenig at http://soundbible.com/950-Bite.html
The "blip" and "jingle" sound effects are by plasterbrain. You can find them at

I am grateful to Jon Henshaw for his excellent tutorial on how to build a
modal with Javascript and CSS.

I also relied heavily on James Long's tutorial, "Making Sprite-based Games
with Canvas," at http://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas

Thanks also to Derek Detweiler for help with canvas resizing:

Mark Pilgrim's online ebook "Dive Into HTML5" was an indispensible resource. Find his
chapter on canvas drawing here: http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html

And many thanks to the Udacity community for their support.
